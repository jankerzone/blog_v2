PaperMod is now powering the refreshed Jankerzone blog. Expect faster pages, automatic dark mode, and a better reading experience out of the box.

## Whatâ€™s inside

- Clean PaperMod styling with built-in search, breadcrumbs, and code copy buttons
- Sensible defaults for SEO (robots.txt, RSS, schema, and social metadata)
- Simple menus for `Home` and `Posts`, so navigation works before any custom content

## Next steps

- Draft new articles with `hugo new posts/my-next-post.md`
- Customize `hugo.toml` to update branding, analytics, or social links
- Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host once happy with the content

Happy writing!
